# Estimating and visualising prevalences of health outcomes using survey data

Objective :

The aim of this research project is to estimate and visualize the prevalence of breast and cervical cancer across Kenya, utilizing spatial and statistical approaches. 
The objectives of this research are to estimate the national, county, and sub-county-level prevalence of breast and cervical cancers along with their confidence intervals; 
to explore the spatial patterns of these conditions across the country; and to enhance the precision of these estimates using small area estimation techniques. 
Additionally, this study involves the development of an interactive Shiny app to support decision-making and foster public engagement.
